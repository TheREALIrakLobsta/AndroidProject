# IM-Ask
IM-Ask is android studio project With a firebase that I built for my university friends,where juniors and Seniors can post the query
and the community will respond,For posting a query you will need to write query and then select any of the image from your gallery 
that define your problem and post it,without wirting query and uploading image query won't be post as I have made constraint on it.
Some accounts are already created e.g one with id=112233 pass=112233,if you want to create account you would need to add id in number
i.e your student id of university,password is also in number,click sign up,After new section will open now upload your image write name,
email and semester and join the community.It is not yet deployed in university yet, because I want to add some new features in it.
